# Python-project-Heathcare_treatment-
Healthcare Treatment Analysis Objective Analyze healthcare treatment data to identify trends in treatment outcomes, costs, and disease severity using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
🏥 Healthcare Cost Analysis Using Python
This project presents a data-driven analysis of treatment costs across healthcare facilities in India, utilizing Python's powerful data science libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The aim is to uncover trends, disparities, and patterns in medical expenses based on demographics, treatment types, and age groups, helping improve affordability and transparency in healthcare services.

📌 Project Objective
To explore and visualize the distribution and structure of treatment costs in the Indian healthcare system using real-world data. The project focuses on identifying key cost drivers, detecting anomalies, and highlighting demographic-based differences in healthcare expenses.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code / IDLE

CSV Dataset (sourced from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India)

🔍 Key Features
Missing Value Handling: Replaced missing treatment costs with median values to ensure accuracy.

Outlier Management: Removed extreme values (top 1–5%) for more readable visualizations.

Feature Engineering: Created age groups for comparative cost analysis.

Sampling: Implemented random sampling for large datasets (>10,000 rows) to improve processing speed.

📊 Visualizations
KDE Plot: Visualizes the overall distribution of treatment costs.

Violin Plot: Compares cost spread across genders.

Swarm Plot: Shows individual treatment cost patterns based on gender and age.

Bar Chart: Highlights the top 5 costliest treatment types.

Heatmap: Displays correlation between numerical features (e.g., age and cost).

Boxplot: Analyzes cost variation across age groups.

📈 Insights & Applications
Identifies the most expensive treatments and cost disparities based on gender and age.

Helps policymakers and healthcare analysts understand where subsidies or reforms are most needed.

Serves as a foundation for predictive modeling and deeper health economics research.
